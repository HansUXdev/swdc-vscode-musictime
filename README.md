## Getting started

### **1. Connect your Spotify account**

Click the **Connect Spotify** button in the status bar or in the playlist tree, which will prompt you to log in to your Spotify account.

</p>

### **2. Control your music and playlists right from your editor**

Click on any song in your list of playlists. Music Time will prompt you to open a Spotify player‚Äîeither the desktop app or web player.

    Music Time requires a premium Spotify account and an internet connection to control your music on Windows and Linux. If you are on a Mac, Music Time can also control the Spotify desktop app using AppleScript as either a premium or non-premium user.

### **3. Generate your personal playlist**

Click the **Generate AI Playlist** button to get a personalized AI playlist generated using deep learning. Your playlist improves as you listen to more music.

</p>

### **4. Try a song recommendation**

Find songs similar to your listening history. Try high tempo, high energy, and high valence songs for upbeat work or Classical or Piano for slower, more complex coding. Add a song to a playlist using the "+" button.

</p>

### **6. Check out the Software Top 40**

Discover new music from developers around the world in a playlist generated by our algorithms. The Software Top 40 playlist is refreshed every week.

## Find your most productive music

As you listen to music while you code, we calculate a productivity score by combining your coding metrics with your listening history and data from over 10,000 developers.

Here are the different ways you can discover your most productive music.

### **1. View your web analytics**

Click on the ‚ÄúSee Web Analytics‚Äù button to see your most productive songs, artists, and genres by productivity score. You can also visit app.software.com/login and use your Spotify email address to log in.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">

</p>

### **2. Open your Music Time dashboard**

Click the ‚Äúüéß‚Äù icon in the status bar then **Music Time Dashboard** to generate an in-editor report of your top songs, artists, and genres by productivity score.

</p>

### **3. Explore your music metrics**

Discover how the underlying [metrics of music](app.software.com/music/metrics) (including tempo, loudness, speechiness, energy, and valence) impact how you code.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="./images/music-metrics.png" alt="Music Time music metrics" />
</p>

### **4. Visualize your Code Time metrics**

Music Time captures the same data as our [Code Time plugin](https://github.com/swdotcom/swdc-vscode), such as your keystrokes, time by file and project, and lines of code. This data is used to calculate your productivity scores. You can also [visit your feed](app.software.com) to see simple visualizations of your Code Time data, such as a rolling heatmap of your top programming times by hour of the day.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">

</p>

## Share your top songs

Share your top songs on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Tumblr by clicking on the share icon next to a song in the playlist tree. You can also Connect Slack to share songs with your team.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="./images/share-button.png" alt="Share button" />
</p>

Connecting Slack requires team member permissions or above. You will not be able to connect Slack as a single or multi-channel guest.
